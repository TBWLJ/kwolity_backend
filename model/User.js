// This code defines a Mongoose schema for a User model in a Node.js application.
// The schema includes fields for name, email, password, and createdAt timestamp.
// The name and email fields are required, with the email field being unique.
// The password field is also required and must be at least 6 characters long.
// The createdAt field defaults to the current date and time when a new user is created.
// Finally, the User model is exported for use in other parts of the application.
// This code is typically used in a Node.js application that uses MongoDB as its database.
// Mongoose is a popular ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
// The schema helps in defining the structure of the user documents in the MongoDB collection.
// This code is typically placed in a separate file (e.g., model/User.js) to keep the code organized.
// It can be used in conjunction with other parts of the application, such as routes and controllers,
// to handle user-related operations like registration, login, and profile management.
// The User model can be used to create, read, update, and delete user documents in the MongoDB database.
// This code is essential for building user authentication and management features in a web application.
// It ensures that user data is stored in a structured way, making it easier to query and manipulate.
// The use of Mongoose allows for validation and type checking, ensuring data integrity.
